# NFA_to_DFA
A simple program implementing NFA to DFA conversion

How to use this program?
1. Download all the three files and put them under the same file.
2. Run main.py.
3. Follow the instructions in the terminal. Input the transition relations, initial state and final states.
4. The corresponding DFA will be printed in the terminal.

Example input and output:
(You can also find example test cases at the top of the main file)
